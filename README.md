# B-Gneh
A python script that finds the cheapest electronic component by searching in all the popular stores.

## Supported Stores
- [Future Electronics](https://store.fut-electronics.com/)
- [El-Gammal Electronics](http://elgammalelectronics.com/)
- [RAM Electronics](https://ram-e-shop.com/)
- [Free Electronics](https://free-electronic.com/)

Note: This is still a work in progress, my api wrappers are very basic and still need more polishing.

## TODO:
